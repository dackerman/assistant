        'DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) is the fundamental molecule that carries genetic information in living organisms. Let me explain how it works:\n\n## Structure of DNA\n\n**Double Helix**: DNA has a twisted ladder-like structure called a double helix, discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953.\n\n**Components**:\n- **Sugar-phosphate backbone**: Forms the "sides" of the ladder\n- **Nitrogenous bases**: Form the "rungs" of the ladder\n  - Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T)\n  - Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C)\n\n## How DNA Works\n\n### 1. Information Storage\n- DNA stores genetic information in the sequence of its four bases (A, T, G, C)\n- This sequence acts like a code or instruction manual for building and maintaining an organism\n- Genes are specific segments of DNA that code for particular traits or proteins\n\n### 2. DNA Replication\n- Before cell division, DNA must be copied so each new cell gets a complete set\n- The double helix unwinds and each strand serves as a template\n- New complementary strands are built following base-pairing rules\n- Result: Two identical DNA molecules from one original\n\n### 3. Protein Synthesis\n**Transcription**: \n- DNA code is copied into RNA (messenger RNA or mRNA)\n- This happens in the cell nucleus\n\n**Translation**:\n- mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm\n- Ribosomes "read" the mRNA code in groups of three bases (codons)\n- Each codon specifies which amino acid to add\n- Amino acids link together to form proteins\n\n### 4. Inheritance\n- DNA is passed from parents to offspring\n- Sexual reproduction combines DNA from both parents\n- Mutations can create genetic variation\n\n## Key Functions\n- **Blueprint for life**: Contains instructions for building and operating cells\n- **Heredity**: Passes traits from generation to generation\n- **Protein production**: Controls which proteins are made when and where\n- **Cell regulation**: Controls cell growth, division, and function\n\nDNA is essentially a biological hard drive that stores, copies, and expresses the information needed for life!',

        'A protein is a large, complex molecule made up of amino acids that performs essential functions in living organisms. Let me break this down:\n\n## What Are Proteins?\n\n**Basic Structure**: Proteins are chains of smaller units called **amino acids** linked together like beads on a string. There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined in countless ways.\n\n## Protein Structure Levels\n\n1. **Primary Structure**: The sequence of amino acids in the chain\n2. **Secondary Structure**: Local folding patterns (like spirals or sheets)\n3. **Tertiary Structure**: Overall 3D shape of the protein\n4. **Quaternary Structure**: Multiple protein chains working together\n\n## Major Functions of Proteins\n\n### 1. **Enzymes** (Catalysts)\n- Speed up chemical reactions in the body\n- Examples: Digestive enzymes break down food, DNA polymerase copies DNA\n\n### 2. **Structural Proteins**\n- Provide support and shape to cells and tissues\n- Examples: Collagen (in skin, bones), keratin (in hair, nails)\n\n### 3. **Transport Proteins**\n- Move substances around the body\n- Examples: Hemoglobin carries oxygen in blood\n\n### 4. **Defense Proteins**\n- Protect against disease and infection\n- Examples: Antibodies fight pathogens\n\n### 5. **Hormonal Proteins**\n- Act as chemical messengers\n- Examples: Insulin regulates blood sugar\n\n### 6. **Storage Proteins**\n- Store amino acids and other molecules\n- Examples: Albumin in eggs stores nutrients\n\n### 7. **Motor Proteins**\n- Enable movement\n- Examples: Actin and myosin in muscles\n\n## How Proteins Are Made\n\n1. **DNA** contains the instructions (genes)\n2. **RNA** copies these instructions\n3. **Ribosomes** read the RNA and assemble amino acids in the correct order\n4. The amino acid chain **folds** into its functional 3D shape\n\n## Why Shape Matters\n\n- A protein\'s function depends entirely on its 3D shape\n- If a protein misfolds, it may not work properly\n- This is why conditions like mad cow disease (misfolded proteins) are so serious\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Proteins are the "workhorses" of cells - they do most of the actual work\n- Your body contains thousands of different proteins\n- You need to eat protein because your body breaks it down into amino acids to build new proteins\n- Proteins are essential for growth, repair, and maintenance of all body tissues\n\nThink of proteins as molecular machines - each one has a specific job and a specific shape that allows it to do that job effectively!',
